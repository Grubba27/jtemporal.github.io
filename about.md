I became a data science enthusiast during Biomedical Informatics undergraduate when I learned to seek information in cancer and stem cells sequencing data using R.
Still, in college, I joined the local Python community and did a brief internship as a back-end developer using Python and Django. After that, I went back to analyzing data for a [research project in which I used the Natural Language Processing library NLTK to process tweets](https://jtemporal.com/jessie).

After graduating, I became part of [Operação Serenata de Amor](https://serenata.ai) as a data scientist. Throughout a year, I helped to find irregular expenses made by our government analyzing the Brazilian government open data and gave more than 13 talks over the world. This project is a reference for using technology in the fight against corruption.

After parting ways with the Serenata's team, I joined a startup called Nuveo, once again as a developer this time working with Python and Go to automate processes.
In 2019, I dedicated myself to data science once again as I became part of Grupo Globo's data science team. I analyze data produced inside TV Globo to create insights and generate value in a range of inner areas.

After staying with TV Globo for almost a year, I changed jobs once again, this time joining the iFood's data science tribe working to developing recommendations models to help Brazilians decide on what they would like to eat.

I'm co-host and co-founder of [Pizza de Dados](https://pizzadedados.com), the first data science podcast in Brazil. Pizza is debating topics of data science with specialists in a diverse variety of areas in the field. All the episodes are recorded in Portuguese to help increase data literacy in Brazil.

Other than that, I continue to contribute and maintain open-source projects on GitHub. I'm also part of the instructors' team at Data Bootcamp, and I write technical posts about many technology-related subjects [on my blog](https://jtemporal.com/) and [Pizza's blog](https://medium.com/pizzadedados).
